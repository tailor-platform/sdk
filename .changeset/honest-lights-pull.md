Set labels for resource management

Previously, apply operations targeted all resources in the workspace, so any resources not listed in the config were deleted during apply. This made it practically impossible to create resources managed by Terraform or other SDK projects in the same workspace.

With this change, resources generated by the SDK are now automatically labeled. By only targeting resources with appropriate labels for deletion, coexistence with resources managed elsewhere is now possible. While this label is currently internal, it should become visible in the console in the future.

There are almost no breaking changes, and labels are automatically added when you apply existing projects. The only caveat is that since labels are set based on the application name (name in `defineConfig()`), you can no longer simply change the application name as before (it will cause an error). A separate command for renaming the application will be provided.
