Set labels for resource management

Previously, apply operations targeted all resources in the workspace, so any resources not listed in the config were deleted during apply. This made it practically impossible to create resources managed by Terraform or other SDK applications in the same workspace.

With this change, resources generated by the SDK are now automatically labeled. By only targeting resources with appropriate labels for deletion, coexistence with resources managed elsewhere is now possible. While this label is currently internal, it should become visible in the console in the future.

**Breaking Changes:**

Existing applications are not labeled, so the following warning will appear when you apply for the first time after updating.
Please confirm or pass the `--yes` flag.

```
WARN  Unmanaged resources detected:

  Resources:
    • TailorDB service "my-db"
    • Auth service "my-auth"
    ...

  These resources are not managed by any application.

❯ Add these resources to "my-app"?
○ Yes / ● No
```
